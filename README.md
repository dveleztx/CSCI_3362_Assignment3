# CSCI_3362_Assignment3

## Project Overview
This repository, `CSCI_3362_Assignment3`, contains the code and related resources for the Operating Systems assignment on Scheduling Algorithms. The objective of this assignment is to understand and implement various types of scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin (RR). This project is a part of the Computer Science course, CSCI 3362.

## Setup and Installation

Before you begin, ensure your system has the following software installed:

- A modern web browser.
- A text editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.
- Git, for version control.
- Python 3.8 or later.

To install this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/CSCI_3362_Assignment3.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CSCI_3362_Assignment3
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Examples

Once you've installed the project, you can run the scheduling algorithms as follows:

```bash
python main.py --algorithm FCFS
```

This will run the First-Come, First-Serve algorithm. You can replace `FCFS` with `SJN` or `RR` to run the Shortest Job Next or Round Robin algorithms, respectively.
