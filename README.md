# CSCI_3362_Assignment3

## Project Overview
This repository contains the solutions and documentation for the third assignment of the CSCI 3362 course, focusing on Operating Systems and specifically on Scheduling Algorithms. The project explores various scheduling algorithms used in operating systems to manage processes' execution order efficiently.

### Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Contains all the source code files implementing different scheduling algorithms.
- `doc/`: Documentation related to the project and assignment requirements.
- `tests/`: Test scripts and files to validate the implementation of the scheduling algorithms.
- `examples/`: Example input files and their corresponding outputs for demonstration purposes.

## Setup and Installation

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy library

### Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSCI_3362_Assignment3.git
   cd CSCI_3362_Assignment3
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage Examples

To run a scheduling algorithm simulation, navigate to the `src/` directory and execute one of the scripts. For example, to run the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm, you can use the following command:

```bash
python fcfs.py ../examples/input1.txt
```

This will read the process data from `input1.txt`, execute the FCFS scheduling algorithm, and print the results.
